# abm_sir
an ABM SIR model with individual beta

The SIR model is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivatives of this basic form. 
The model consists of three compartments: 
S for the number of susceptible, I for the number of infectious, and R for the number of recovered or deceased (or immune) individuals. 
(This compartment may also be called "resistant" or "removed.")
This model is reasonably predictive[citation needed] for infectious diseases that are transmitted from human to human, 
and where recovery confers lasting resistance, such as measles, mumps and rubella.

We have two different modality
Each cell can infect its eight (or four) immediate neighbors.
